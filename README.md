# Space-Warfare

## Overview  
A smart spaceship simulation built in **Unreal Engine 5** using **C++**, featuring autonomous combat behavior such as predictive targeting, evasive maneuvers, and a self-destruct mechanism. The simulation models tactical engagement and survival strategies, emphasizing dynamic interactions between entities.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Tracking & Shooting  
When an enemy spaceship enters the field of view, the AI-controlled spaceship locks on, predicts the enemy's future position based on its velocity, and fires with precision.

### ðŸŒ€ Evasive Maneuvers  
Upon detecting incoming enemy fire or being pursued, the spaceship executes evasive actions designed to dodge bullets and confuse enemy targeting systems.

### ðŸ’¥ Collision & Destruction  
The spaceship is programmed to explode under two conditions:  
- Direct collision with another ship.  
- Sustained damage beyond a critical health threshold.  

This adds realism to space combat scenarios and enforces tactical awareness.
